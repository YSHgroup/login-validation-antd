# It utilizes `Ant Design` as the UI component library for this project.

# The project has a basic file structure that includes two example components for the 1st stage: `ErrorText` and `Select`. Since there is already a pre-built `Select` component available in the Ant Design library, there is no need to create a custom `Select` component separately.

# In the second stage, for the `Password` component, the Ant Design library provides support for the `Input.Password` component. Therefore, the `ErrorText` component does not need to be applied to the `Password` component.
